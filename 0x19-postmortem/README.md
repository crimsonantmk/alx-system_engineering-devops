Postmortem: Company Blog Slow Image Loading
Issue Summary:

Duration: Wednesday, May 29th, 2024, 14:00 EAT - 15:45 EAT (1 hour 45 minutes)
Impact: Users visiting our company blog experienced slow loading times for images. Images appeared pixelated or took a significant amount of time to load fully. Approximately 30% of our daily blog visitors were affected during the outage window.
Root Cause: A configuration error in our Content Delivery Network (CDN) caused images to be served from a geographically distant origin server, resulting in increased latency.
Timeline:

14:00 EAT: Customer support receives reports of slow image loading on the company blog.
14:05 EAT: Engineering team investigates. Initial focus is on the blog application and image optimization techniques, assuming a performance bottleneck within the application itself.
14:15 EAT: Review of application logs reveals no errors related to image processing. Investigation expands to the CDN configuration.
14:30 EAT: Analysis of CDN logs indicates a surge in traffic originating from a specific region. However, this doesn't explain the slow image loading experienced by users globally.
14:45 EAT: The CDN provider is contacted for assistance. A joint investigation identifies a misconfiguration in the CDN's origin server settings. Images were being served from a geographically distant server, leading to increased latency for users in other regions.
15:00 EAT: The CDN configuration is corrected, routing image traffic to the nearest origin server based on user location.
15:30 EAT: Blog image loading times return to normal. Monitoring confirms successful image delivery from geographically appropriate servers.
15:45 EAT: The incident is declared resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a configuration error in the CDN. The origin server setting was inadvertently changed, causing images to be served from a server located far away from a significant portion of our user base. This resulted in increased latency and slow loading times for images. Working with the CDN provider, the configuration was corrected to route image traffic to the nearest origin server based on user location, effectively resolving the issue.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Strengthen CDN configuration review: Implement a more rigorous review process for CDN configuration changes. This could involve a two-person approval system and testing the impact of changes in a staging environment before deployment.
Enhanced CDN monitoring: Expand CDN monitoring to include origin server selection and identify potential misconfigurations before they impact user experience. Alerts can be set up to notify engineers of any unexpected changes.
Regular CDN configuration audits: Schedule periodic audits of the CDN configuration to ensure optimal performance and adherence to best practices.
This incident highlights the importance of proper CDN configuration and monitoring. By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we can minimize the risk of similar performance issues in the future and ensure a fast and seamless user experience for visitors to our company blog.
